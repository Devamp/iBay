## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive replication of the eBay auction platform, developed using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server stack. My goal was to recreate the core functionality of eBay, allowing users to actively engage in auctions through live bidding, all while ensuring accurate real-time updates of ongoing auctions.

## Features

This eBay Replica project showcases several key features:

- **Live Bidding**: Users can actively participate in auctions through live bidding, experiencing the thrill of competitive auctions in real-time.

- **Real-time Updates**: The application ensures that ongoing auctions receive real-time updates, allowing users to stay informed about the latest bids and auction status.

- **Full-Stack Development**: We have demonstrated our expertise in full-stack development by effectively organizing and maintaining both the front-end and backend components of this eBay replica.

## Technologies Used

The project is built on the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack, which provides a robust foundation for web application development. Here are the key technologies used:

- **Linux**: As the operating system, providing a stable environment for hosting the web application.

- **Apache**: Serving as the web server, handling HTTP requests and responses.

- **MySQL**: Acting as the database management system, responsible for storing and retrieving auction data.

- **PHP**: The scripting language used for server-side development, creating dynamic web pages and handling user interactions.

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The trio of technologies used for the front-end development, creating the user interface and enhancing user experience.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This project was developed on personal student database provided by the University of Portland, this account along with the database is now deactivated. Although, I believe this project can be setup on a different LAMP stack.
